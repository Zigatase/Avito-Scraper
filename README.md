# Avitp-Scrapir

The other day I was asked to write Scrapir bulletin boards where people sell their stuff.

It was necessary to collect all the data about the product and I did it.

I used Python and its libraries such as Requests, BeautifulSoup, Fake-UserAgent, lxml, csv.

I also had to use a proxy.

You can see what I did in the end, I know my code is not perfect and there is much to work on.
